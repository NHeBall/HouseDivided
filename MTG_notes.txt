TO DO
##########
DONE, check other branches
research_time_factor has been changed into research_speed_factor, what was negative is now positive and vice-versa

check loc for changes

I have disabled governments in exile for now, can be enabled in ideology file

MOSTLY DONE, DOUBLE-CHECK
replace submarine, cruiser, destroyer, battlecruiser, battleship, carrier tech bonuses from technologies to categories (ss_tech, cl_tech & ca_tech, dd_tech, bc_tech, bb_tech, cv_tech)

do something with naval treaties?

things needed for tech extension:
- advanced decimetric radar to be conencted with new fire control systems (electronics)
- fuel silos/refining (industry)
- add AI weights to make CHN prioritize synthetic oil/rubber
- amphibious_mechanized extension - possibly make late-game mech amphibious (like RL BMPs? maybe make subtechs?)
- ship_anti_air extension? same with MtG stuff

new tech file MTG_naval, old naval file is almost untouched

OIL AS A RESOURCE IS NOT USED TO BUILD UNITS ANYMORE
looks like only the archetype has fuel consumption set

new names_ships folder in common/units

NEW THINGS
##########
New Army Chief, army_chief_planning, increases planning_speed
New Air Marshal, air_pilot_training, increases air_training_xp_gain_factor
max_fuel_factor is a thing

has_game_rule = {
	rule = PRC_ai_behavior
	option = RANDOM
}
they just use country flags assigned by random list on startup for game rules

give_resource_rights

ai_equipment: These scripts are used to direct AI to create equipment variants and upgrade
existing equipment in order to satisfy specific role needs.  Equipment type and
equipment module specifications determine what is necessary and desirable for
filling particular roles, and priority triggers provide additional hooks to
encourage the AI in different directions.

Decisions: foreign_influence for influencing ideology in puppets - possibly unnecessary?

dynamic_modifiers - none are used in vanilla
